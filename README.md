## üìå Overview
This is a comprehensive ethical hacking toolkit written in Bash that provides penetration testers with a wide range of security testing capabilities. The script features an interactive menu system with modules for network reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, password attacks, web application testing, and post-exploitation techniques.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Legal Notice:**  
This tool is for **authorized security testing and educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use against systems you don't own or have permission to test is illegal.

## üîß Installation

### Requirements
- Linux operating system (Kali Linux recommended)
- Root/sudo privileges
- The following packages:
  - nmap
  - hydra
  - nikto
  - sqlmap
  - arpspoof (dsniff package)
  - tcpdump
  - john
  - xsstrike

### Setup
1. Clone or download the script
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x God-ends-here.sh
   ```
3. Run as root:
   ```bash
   sudo ./God-ends-here.sh
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
The script provides an interactive menu system. Simply run the script and select the desired module by entering the corresponding number.

### Example Workflow
1. Start with network reconnaissance to identify hosts
2. Perform port scanning on discovered systems
3. Run vulnerability scans against open services
4. Attempt password attacks if applicable
5. Conduct web application tests if web services are found
6. Use post-exploitation modules if access is gained

## üìù Notes
- Many modules require specific tools to be installed
- Some features like MITM attacks require additional setup
- The script includes warnings before dangerous operations
- Always get proper authorization before testing
